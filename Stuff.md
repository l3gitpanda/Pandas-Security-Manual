Things that were confusing:
Credentials (assuming it was the AD stuff but still confusing)
(next time need to pay more attention to getting a baseline of what we can get into at the beginning)

We honestly didnt get to do really anything other than doing minor ssh hardening on one box and doing a little bit of securing the pfsense box but i would like to know how they originally downed our pfsense box.



Message to WRCCDC/IVC:

Although we probably didn't perform very well, I think it was an amazing experience to get exposure to real world scenarios. I am excited participate next year if the opportunity arises to try again and hopefully do a bit better after being able to prepare. I think it was very difficult to get into with no real experience with cyber competitions aswell as
