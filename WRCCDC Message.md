Things that were confusing:
Credentials (assuming it was the AD stuff but still confusing)
(next time need to pay more attention to getting a baseline of what we can get into at the beginning)

We honestly didnt get to do really anything other than doing minor ssh hardening on one box and doing a little bit of securing the pfsense box but i would like to know how they originally downed our pfsense box.



Message to WRCCDC/IVC:

Although we probably didn't perform very well, I think it was an amazing experience to get exposure to real world Cybersecurity scenarios. I am excited to participate next year if the opportunity arises and hopefully do better after being able to prepare. I think it was very difficult to get into it with no real experience with cyber competitions aswell as no real guidance as to what we were doing until the afternoon before. Aside from all of that, I had a lot of fun exploring the premade environment. I also learned a lot about real world high stress Cybersecurity environments. Thanks so much for the opportunity to compete!
